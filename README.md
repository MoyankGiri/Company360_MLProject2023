## Proposed solution approach
The proposed solution includes majorly 3 modules:
* Company Review Analysis
* Company Reputation Analysis
* Employee Work-Life Analysis

Our solution goes beyond mere aggregation by employing sophisticated natural language
processing and sentiment analysis techniques. This empowers us to not only summarize
a company’s working conditions but also to delve into specific aspects that are frequently
overlooked. By offering a data-driven, nuanced, and comprehensive view of prospective employers,
our project aims to equip job seekers with the tools they need to make informed
decisions. This, in turn, will foster a more transparent and accountable job market, benefitting
both candidates and employers alike.

## What is Unique?
The distinctiveness of our project lies in its holistic approach to understanding companies.
* Reputation Analysis: Strategic reputation analysis caters to those who seek a comprehensive
understanding of a company’s current state and want to anticipate future
challenges. Users can gauge a company’s financial health and whether it’s flourishing
or facing difficulties, assess job security and the potential risks of consequences such
as industry recessions. By aligning with these real-world needs, our project ensures
users are well-prepared to navigate their career journey with confidence and foresight.
* Insights into ”Day in the Life”: The unparalleled element of our project is its
ability to provide users with an intimate look into what it’s like to work at a specific
company on a day-to-day basis. While platforms like Glassdoor offer valuable insights,
we aim to go a step further by offering detailed summaries of employees’ daily experiences
by analyzing youtube transcripts, quora posts, and employee blogs, we aim to
present a detailed understanding of the work culture, job responsibilities, and daily
challenges within a company. This unique feature empowers candidates with a realistic
preview of their potential workplace, enabling them to make well-informed career
decisions.
* Diverse data integration: What sets us apart is our diverse data integration, encompassing
news articles for current reputation and summarising personal experiences
shared on various blogging sites, knowledge sharing platforms and video transcripts. .
