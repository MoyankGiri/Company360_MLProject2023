## Introduction and Problem Motivation
In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the priorities of working professionals
while evaluating the potential employers. Factors such as work-life balance, organizational
culture and values, diversity and inclusion, job security have become increasingly critical in
addition to salary compensation. This shift is evident from the increasing turnover rates
within companies, as individuals are now inclined to gain a more comprehensive understanding
of their potential workplaces. The challenge lies in bridging the information gap,
providing candidates with comprehensive insights into both the advantages and drawbacks
of specific companies. This, in turn, enables them to make informed and strategic career
decisions that promote long-term stability and job satisfaction.
Our project endeavors to address this pressing need by creating a one-stop solution that
caters to the uncertainties and lack of awareness that candidates often face when evaluating
potential employers. We aim to achieve this through aspect-based analysis of the abundant
information available online. This valuable data includes employee reviews sourced from
various job portals, content from online platforms, news articles and transcripts from videos
where employees provide insights into their day-to-day work experiences.
Our solution goes beyond mere aggregation by employing sophisticated natural language
processing and sentiment analysis techniques. This empowers us to not only summarize
a company’s working conditions but also to delve into specific aspects that are frequently
overlooked. By offering a data-driven, nuanced, and comprehensive view of prospective employers,
our project aims to equip job seekers with the tools they need to make informed
decisions. This, in turn, will foster a more transparent and accountable job market, benefitting
both candidates and employers alike.

## Proposed solution approach
The proposed solution includes majorly 3 modules:
* Company Review Analysis
* Company Reputation Analysis
* Employee Work-Life Analysis

## What is Unique?
The distinctiveness of our project lies in its holistic approach to understanding companies.
* Reputation Analysis: Strategic reputation analysis caters to those who seek a comprehensive
understanding of a company’s current state and want to anticipate future
challenges. Users can gauge a company’s financial health and whether it’s flourishing
or facing difficulties, assess job security and the potential risks of consequences such
as industry recessions. By aligning with these real-world needs, our project ensures
users are well-prepared to navigate their career journey with confidence and foresight.
* Insights into ”Day in the Life”: The unparalleled element of our project is its
ability to provide users with an intimate look into what it’s like to work at a specific
company on a day-to-day basis. While platforms like Glassdoor offer valuable insights,
we aim to go a step further by offering detailed summaries of employees’ daily experiences
by analyzing youtube transcripts, quora posts, and employee blogs, we aim to
present a detailed understanding of the work culture, job responsibilities, and daily
challenges within a company. This unique feature empowers candidates with a realistic
preview of their potential workplace, enabling them to make well-informed career
decisions.
* Diverse data integration: What sets us apart is our diverse data integration, encompassing
news articles for current reputation and summarising personal experiences
shared on various blogging sites, knowledge sharing platforms and video transcripts. .
