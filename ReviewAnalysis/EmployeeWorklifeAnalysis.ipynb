    "In the pursuit of understanding the intricacies of a company's culture and the experiences of its employees, the extraction and summarization of work-life anecdotes emerge as a valuable undertaking. In this phase of the project, we delve into the narratives of individuals who have been part of various organizations, gathering insights that encapsulate the essence of their professional journeys. To accomplish this, we employ a combination of web scraping, data extraction, and text summarization techniques, augmented by popular libraries and methodologies in the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By employing these methods, we aim to provide concise and insightful summaries of employees' experiences, enabling a deeper comprehension of the working environments, challenges, and successes that define a company's culture."

      "I have never worked anywhere apart from Google, so I cannot draw a comparison but here is what I think. Pros :I get to work with a set of people who always make me feel shit about myself and make me realize that I know very little. When I joined Google, I suffered from Imposter’s syndrome. I am always out of my comfort zone here. I always know how I can improve. It helps me grow and learn faster.The degree of freedom I have regarding what I want to work on is spectacular. Changing project / team is relatively easier here. I can choose to spend 20% of my time on anything I want.The food and other much talked about perks of Google actually help me improve my productivity. I feel like my employer cares about me and I would like to return the favor. There is even an internal website for employees that talk about how to waste time at Google in a good way.The company invests in growth of it’s employees. There are tons of learning resources. People volunteer to mentor others. I have un-restricted access to most of the code ever written at Google. There are several voluntary trainings and tech-talks. The bottleneck to my learning here is myself.The being “Googley” culture is amazing. Most people I have worked with at Google have high ethical and moral standards. There is a system of continuous feedback. People here are not trying to pull you down. People often get rewarded and recognized via peer-bonuses and public thank yo.There are sufficient number of channels to bubble up my ideas and concerns. There are appropriate mailing list for almost everything from game of thrones to micro-aggressions.Cons :The company is way too big. Re-orgs keep happening. And personal connections aren’t of much use here. What doesn’t get documented never happened here.With every passing day, I feel like Google is becoming less desirable place to work. Perks at many other companies have caught up with those at Google. *Exclusive Google perks* are a thing of past. Things like anti-diversity memo makes me sad.To work on good things, you need to be good and to improve yourself you need to work on good things. That’s a deadlock I often face at Google. There is no easy way around. It’s hard to convince people here that you can get something done mostly because everyone is so damn smart.A large part of knowledge and experience gained at Google is not transferable. There is always an internal (and in most cases better) version of most popular technologies available. I hardly ever use any tool / technology that has not been invented at Google. If I ever go out of Google, I will probably have to learn a lot of standard tools popular outside Google.On his 10th work anniversary, my manager at Google was asked how did he feel about his 10 years. He said something similar to : “If you wake up one morning and don’t feel like going to work it’s okay. However, I would be worried if that happens often. For the past 10 years, everyday when I wake up in the morning, I have a new challenge waiting for me. I always feel excited about coming to work. I never feel like like not going to work” I think, that is what drives a lot of people at Google, including myself.\n",

      "I've worked at Google as both a contractor and a full-time employee. What it's like should be divided into two categories: official policies, and your actual perception. The latter depends a lot on your team; in mine, all but the PM are contractors, so there's no discrimination or anything. Here are Google's official policies regarding contractors:Your badge is red and has a 'C' on itYou're specifically instructed to NOT say on your social media profiles that you work for Google. You work for <company xyz> AT Google. This may confuse some folks and has less of the ring of \"I work at Google\".Some rare areas of the Googleplex may not be open to contractors. Not sure which. Haven't seen anything restricted yet that I wanted to check out.No access to the corporate wiki, which tends to have old stuff anyway. New stuff goes on Google Sites. You can also request access to the corp wiki if you need information stored there, which is easy to justify as various programming guidelines/styles are on it.You have to pay a nominal fee ($1.50) to be able to use shuttles, so the IRS doesn't consider them employee benefits. But other than that, cafeterias, snacks, gyms, showers etc. are free to allYou have to fill in a timesheet for your employer. This is mostly a formality.Hardware is second tier for contractors. E.g. used/refurbished laptop, previous gen. desktopsYou also get only one desktop OR laptop as a contractor. Employees easily get both. However, if your manager and their director approve your request for an extra machine, you're good. Without a corporate laptop, you can't access the internal network unless you're on Google's campus Wi-Fi, which surprisingly doesn't include the one in shuttles.You can't officially use many educational opportunities (\"Grow\"), e.g. instructor classes. Presumably if you show up to audit something, you won't be kicked out though.+ some related tools, like FreshLens (giving feedback as an outsider to Google Products, when you're new to Google), are limited to employeesShouldn't bring in guests. Employees can, and delight the guests with Google's free food.Some special occasion perks (I imagine most) are limited to employees. One example was the BMW Drive Now program, which has a membership special for Googlers.A bunch of events are for employees only. Others are specifically open to contractors (e.g. Movie nights). Others don't specify, and probably nobody will mind (e.g. speakers or fitness instructors of all sorts).However, you still have access to on-site facilities (cafeterias, gyms, mail, laundry, bike repair or whatnot). Anyway, as a contractor, you're probably (hopefully) well-paid, so do your job and stop looking for stuff to mooch :) One odd pro about working as a contract is that you don’t have to go through the performance review cycle. Some have complained that this perf process has caused some perverse incentives at Google: teams or employees launch new products mainly to get promoted, or people who deserve promotions don’t get them for unclear reasons. Another one is that you probably will be able to focus on one thing and do that well. Some other roles have to deal with a variety of technologies and they end up knowing a bit about a lot, but lack deep expertise on any topic. Overall, I haven't had problems as a contractor (save for a snag re. requesting a laptop). Tickets that I filed were generally treated as seriously as I expected those submitted by an employees would be. Note that I was contracting through E-Touch, a staffing agency. I don’t know what it’s like to contract as yourself.\n",

      "Google's Tokyo office was the first international office. It's where creative, passionate people come together and is one of the best place to work in Japan. It's located in Roppongi Hills Mori Tower (Tokyo’s fifth-tallest building, and home to the Mori Art Museum). It has got a table tennis, a pool table, a music room, an espresso bar, and many more things.To get the feel of traditional ryokan, the office also features the classic Japanese design. You can see Mt. Fuji and feel relaxed while enjoying your work. You can enjoy local specialties like curries, noodle dishes and sashimi (it’s Sushi Friday every Friday!) and food from around the world. There is even a special tatami-style seating where you have to take off your shoes to eat. Engineers here work on Search, Ads, Maps, Chrome, Google+ and Android and the products that make huge impacts in Japan and also benefit millions of users around the world.Source: Tokyo - Google Careers It was Google Tokyo that built the person finder app in 2 hours after the earthquake and the tsunami of 2011 which helped people to locate people and also find data on which routes are working and operational in real time. You would get to see lot of awesome events. Celebrities like Ryuichi Sakamoto and the J-pop group AKB48 have already performed here. Googlers here also get to go on really cool off-sites with their teams – everything from horseback, riding to annual ski trip. You can also see a lot of hackathon taking place here. In short, it's perfect environment for growth and fun and create an impact with the skills you have.\n",

      "EDIT: Please do not PM me about how to get a job at Google. There are a ton of brilliant Quora answers out there which will be able to guide you much better. Thank you. Disclaimers:1. All views listed are my own. Google doesn't endorse them. It may or may not be applicable to other Indian Googlers. Most points are based on my perception. Some one else may have perceived things differently. Let’s agree to disagree :) 2. I worked in Hyderabad office. So some of the answers might be more applicable to Google Hyderabad vs Google Bangalore or say Mumbai. I have not worked in all the organisations at Google India. Most of them may be more applicable to my organisation than others. 3. I am no longer employed with Google. I left to pursue higher education. What is it like to work at Google India? Let me share some of my experiences in form of short stories/snippets. I have divided the answer into 2 sections - Exceeds expectations (thing that Google India does really really well) and Needs Improvement (things that can be made better). EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS a. PERKSOne fine Monday morning, I had a single ten rupee note in my wallet. I checked my wallet again on Friday evening and it still had that single ten rupee note in it. At Google I don't spend a dime during weekdays. I reach office in an office provided cab, eat at the free Google cafes, have snacks and dinner at the office itself and then reach home in one of the office cabs.One of my favorite perks of working at Google India was sleeping in the office cabs on my way to home after a hectic day at work. Also, the cab service is only offered in India. In US, Google provides a shuttle service but the cab service doesn’t exist in any other country (to the best of my knowledge).Talking about wallets, the security is pretty great. You can leave your wallet, watch, laptop etc. anywhere in the office and can expect to find it back in the same place the next day or with security. In my 2 years at Google, I never heard of anyone’s stuff getting stolen.Most roles allow for some overseas travel opportunities. I went on a business trip to Europe. I followed all the guidelines for daily allowances (which is pretty generous) and wasn't asked a single question about it. I had drinks when I wanted to and had all kinds of exotic food on the company's card. Some Companies are cost driven where as Google is Value driven. (The cost of asking for business justification for each & every bill is more expensive than letting the employee do some productive work in that time. See point no. 4 under culture)Google offers a generous dental and vision insurance on top of health insurance. I underwent LASIK surgery and it was covered by Google’s vision insurance completely. Generally LASIK is considered as a cosmetic surgery and is not covered in most insurances.I know a couple of Indian Googlers who will never leave Google just for the amazing health insurance that it provides to some of their family members who need permanent medical attention.During employment, if you undertake any professional course that is related to your job, then Google reimburses 2/3 of the total cost. In case of personal development, Google reimburses 1/3 of the cost. Guitar lessons, Dancing lessons, learning a new language etc. come under the purview of personal reimbursement. I have used personal reimbursement couple of times and it was a smooth process. (Upload the bills and fill a small form and done)Much has been said about Google’s food over the inter webs. I don’t have anything new to add to it, but you realise the importance of it during the weekends when you have to get your own food. (I am a bachelor who lives alone and doesn’t like to cook)Other perks that I have enjoyed during my tenure in Google India - On site Gym, playing table tennis, pool, xbox, foosball, concierge service which takes care of all your daily errands like dispatching a courier, paying bills etc. (not free but nominal), laundry service (not free), mail room where you can order all your Amazon and Flipkart goodies :D. Also, there is an in house coffee shop(free), library in the office, culture club, theatre club, football club, cricket club,basketball club (in Hyderabad at least).Google tries it best to care for you. They celebrate every employee’s work anniversary by decorating their work desk and offering them some massage points which in India translates to 60 minutes of free massage.This is how my desk looked like on my 2nd work anniversary. If it makes any difference, I was on my notice period on this day.9. Free Goodies. Team has extra budget? Great, let’s order some goodies. Organisation has some cash leftover from the annual budget? Great. Let’s order some goodies. I have received Google t-shirts (5–6) , couple of hoodies,external hard disk, wireless speakers, headphones, backpacks, selfie stick, neck pillow, keychains, pen drives, coffee mugs etc. in just 2 years. The amount of money Google spends on each employee is staggering. A lot of other companies would pat themselves in the back for saving some money from a party budget and carry it over to the next year. Not Google :) Talking about goodies, the grand daddy of them all - the annual Christmas gift awarded to each employee. I received a Nexus 5X last Christmas and an Android One phone the year before on Diwali. b. CULTUREGoogle allows you to be yourself. They don’t have a one screw fits all bolts policy. Come at what time you want & leave when you want to. There is no concept of attendance or normal office hours. One of my colleagues who got an exceptional rating last cycle had the habit of coming to office at 3 pm. (In his defense, he did work till 12 in the night.)You can wear whatever you want to. No dress code bullshit. You are not judged on how well your shirt is pressed.One of the unsaid rules of working at Google is - Be Nice and Be Respectful. People hold doors for you. You will hold doors for people. Expect to hear the word “Thanks” (or some variant) every other sentence.Elimination of bureaucratic bullshit. Google tries its best to eliminate hassles for its employees. There are proper channels for everything. Have a question about your latest payslip? Mail an email alias and get your concern addressed in 24 hours or less. Need to get some expenses reimbursed? Go to an internal portal and fill out a form and done. You don’t have to jump through the hoops to get things done. This is true for pretty much everything.There is an internal memes site ( check out Eric Schmidt’s book for more details) where you can criticise the CEO, senior VPs, management etc. without any repercussions. You can voice your disagreement and it is OK!. You can respectfully agree to disagree. Also, Googlers are the first to be up in arms against any decision taken by the company which may not be in the user’s best interests. ( Integrating G+ with Youtube was an unpopular decision internally and people weren’t shy when it came to expressing their disagreement)Google India celebrates multiple festivals every year by decorating the office and preparing special food on those days. It also has Bring your children to work multiple times a year where they install make shift slides & play houses in the office for children. Also, there are multiple initiatives organised by Googlers and for Googlers to give something back to society.c. WORK Your work will largely depend on which organisation you join and on your skill sets.Annual increments every year are quite generous. The only time people bitch about their increments is when they compare it against their neighbor. “I only got 20% while so and so got 30% last year blah blah”. Obviously, increments are dependent on your current base salary and your appraisals.You can say NO to projects. If the project doesn’t interest you, then you can decline to take it up. Obviously you need to convince your manager. Most managers will agree to not give you some project which you don’t want to undertake.Google has a pretty good internal mobility program. But the competition is very immense.( See point no.1 in Needs Improvement section)Needs ImprovementOne of my colleagues used to jokingly say that Google hires Ph.Ds to work as janitors. This is true to a large extent. Google hires CEOs to work as mid level managers. Most of the people who work at Google (and in India too) are way over-qualified for their jobs. If Google India wants to hire someone to write an email, they will go and hire a topper from DU. If they want to hire someone who can provide call support to users, they will go and hire an English hons. topper from DU (Do remember that you need some 99% in your boards to just clear DU’s cut off) . There are Ph.Ds at Google from IVY league colleges who just move data from one database to the other. You can see the pattern. This leads to immense competition.Most of the interesting roles are in Mountain View. The Engineering division in Hyderabad and Bangalore work on Google Apps for Work. It is a small team. I am not sure about the exact numbers but it is definitely less 1% of the total engineering workforce at Google. The two largest organisations at Google India are the sales org and the anti-abuse wing of Google which take down offensive content. If you come to work at Google India don’t expect to work on some cutting edge product like Driverless cars, Brain or Loon. Expect to work on something boring.Google India offers very limited scope for career growth. You obviously can’t become the CEO/SVP/VP working from India when more than 80% of your workforce is based out of Mountain View. The roles in India are very limited too since only a handful organisations are based out of India. Sooner than later, anyone, who has some iota of ambition and are not constrained by family, move to Mountain View. (The internal mobility is pretty great by the way minus the tons of competition for good roles. See point no. 1)Google runs a lot of programs to train its management and provides a lot of support to its employees to keep them stress free and remove all politics from the workplace. However, Google is a system run by people and at the end of the day people are flawed. Some politics does creep into the picture. It might be comparatively less than many other places but it does exist.Promotions in the non-tech organisations are very messy. It comes down to how much your manager is willing to push for your case. So, if you don’t have the best of relationships with your manager or your manager doesn’t like your face then find a new manager ASAP. If your manager is someone who backs down easily then say bye-bye to your promotion. I knew a guy on the floor who would stand behind his reportees like a wall (the noun, not Rahul Dravid). Multiple reportees in his team got promoted each cycle. Same cannot be said about the manager who had the reputation of backing down easily. It is not like there weren’t any hard-working or deserving candidates in the latter’s team. The scene is significantly different and less messy for tech ladders.Talking about Promotions, the lack of transparency around the committee who sits down to evaluate your candidature for promotion can be unnerving. Google allows you to be yourself & disagree with the decisions of the upper management. But at the back of your mind, you are always scared of what you say because you never know at what stage it may come to bite you in your backside. Almost any senior person on the floor can get you screwed out of your promotion. You absolutely cannot afford to piss off anyone who sits in one of those promo committees. What if the senior manager whose XYZ decision you disagreed with says he is not happy with your work in one of those closed committee meetings. If your immediate manager doesn’t fight tooth and nail for you, your promotion is gone. This point is specially true for Google India. I don’t think Google India managers are good at taking criticisms from their reportees. Almost all the questions asked during town hall meetings are anonymous. If the management doesn’t allow anonymous questions for some town hall, no questions are asked in that town hall. There is a lot of mistrust between management and non-management.This needs to be FIXED ASAP.Google India takes an awfully long time to weed out bad managers. Managers with bad approval ratings are given multiple chances to become better at their job. It can take anywhere from 3 years to Never for Google to identify a bad manager and ask them to either become an individual contributor or find another role somewhere else. Problem with this is the following : A bad individual contributor screws up a project. A bad manager screws up the career of their multiple reportees, multiple projects, the entire team and relationship with stakeholders.That being said, Google does put in some checks through the internal culture & escalation mediums that ensures that your manager will show consideration for you as a human being (unlike the notorious Indian IT industry where you are addressed as a ‘resource’ and not a human being). However, some people are simply not cut out for people management. I don’t blame Google for any of this. I simply hope they get better at filtering out such candidates early on and removing them sooner. They should also change the annual Manager feedback survey to bi-annual and make it more actionable & hold the manager responsible. Currently, the manager feedback survey is useless and is only used for the manager to self-introspect. So, if a particular manager thinks along the lines of ‘Hey. I am a good manager. All of these people reporting under me who have given me an approval of only 30% are idiots. I don’t care about this survey’ then the survey becomes entirely meaningless. There is no accountability for a manger with a bad survey rating.This might be slightly controversial but - Google doesn’t fire anyone for low performance. How is this a con? Let me explain. Amazon has a policy of firing 10% of its staff every year after stack ranking them. Google rarely fires anyone for low performance. At best after multiple bad reviews, they are asked to find a new team or job and are given enough time to do so. Both Google and Amazon in my opinion are at the two extreme ends of the spectrum. One leads to slack while the other leads to stress over fear of losing your job. I think a middle path is a more suitable approach. My 2 cents. That being said, Google does provide incentives for you to work hard. Hard work leads to good ratings which leads to better pay, more equity, better & faster career growth. However, you will occasionally find some people who are content with putting in their absolute minimum at the job and are simply happy with their take home salary and flying under the radar of the management.Google India is notorious at hiring people at the wrong level. I know so many people who were hired one level below than they should have been. If you are offered a job at Google India, then definitely try to reach out to an existing Indian Googler and evaluate which level is suitable for your profile and try to negotiate with your recruiter. Also, don’t let them push you around. Some recruiters think they have the birthright to hire you at the wrong level for a low salary because they are offering you a chance to work at Google.Again, this point is applicable only for non-tech ladders. Google uses internal tools for everything. You will learn a lot of skills during your job but most of them won’t translate to something that you can re-use in the industry. You will have to rely on your soft skills to get your next job.Open Work space: The floor can be very noisy at times (specially post 5 pm) and sometimes it can be impossible to work without your headphones on. For whatever reasons beyond my comprehension, a few folks used to take meetings from their desks and take 30 min+ personal calls sitting on their desk, happily oblivious of the amount of noise & annoyance they are causing to everyone in the bay. You either need to put on headphones or go up to them and request them to move somewhere else. Most often than not, it is you who will either put on the headphones or move somewhere else because you don’t want to appear rude.The amount of freebies & other perks can sometimes make you entitled. Some become more entitled than others. Some bad apples do treat the temporary employees (TVCs) with disrespect. Some engineering guys do look down on non-engineering guys. (Please notice the word - some. Some doesn’t mean all)Your work doesn’t speak for you. You need to spend a lot of time to market your work. This includes sending emails, reaching out to upper management during their office hours and very subtly praise yourself and your work, speaking out during meetings and again talking about your work and so on. This can be difficult for introverts and for people who are uncomfortable with boasting about their work.Related to Promotions - The amount of work put by you is completely meaningless. To get promoted, you need to deliver on projects and show impact. If the management keeps flip flopping on the scope of the project or you are collaborating with someone who doesn’t care, then either you need to Superman up and deliver the project end to end all by yourself or forget about your promotion. Also, even if you successfully execute a very complex project but for whatever reason, the metrics gods aren’t favorable to you and the impact numbers don’t look good, then it won’t do you much good. On the other hand, it is quite possible for someone to land a super easy project and gain a lot of brownie points by showing some good numbers thanks to business requirements of that particular product.The Microsoft Problem. Google India, like Google is expanding at a fast rate. This means more competition and lesser budgets for everything. The budgets for parties, gifts, events, off sites have decreased over the years. Don’t get me wrong, the perks and budgets are still very high, but every time the number of coffee machines on the floor get reduced or your favorite expensive candy in the micro kitchen go missing or the size of the packets of cookies in micro kitchen go from large to small, a lot of old timers start speculating about the upcoming apocalypse. (Apocalypse here being end of perks and culture as we know it)Throw Nooglers in the ocean and let them either learn to swim or drown completely (metaphorical). This is more of a Google culture and less of a Google India culture. As a new joinee, and after a couple of short meetings explaining the role of your team, you are expected to fly on your own. You are given a span of 3- 6 months to ramp up and learn things on your own. If you run into a problem, you are expected to reach out to someone and seek help. No body will come and ask you if you need help. I am not sure why I am including this in the needs improvement section. Google hires self-starters & ambitious people who like to get things done. However, in the beginning this can be very intimidating and you are expected to struggle a lot. Even basic things at Google from getting the right accesses and getting added to the correct groups to submitting a simple change in the codebase will require you to read some internal documentation or ask someone for help.Bottom line : You will come to work for Google India for the brand and leave to pursue better quality work elsewhere (either to Mountain View or to another company). Google India is a very good employer and treats you well but once the honeymoon period is over, it is the quality of work which will keep you satisfied (or dissatisfied) at the work place and no amount of free chocolates or other freebies will be able to compensate for it. So choose your role wisely and don’t expect flying unicorns or something. Do keep in mind that all the free stuff will cease to excite you..just like your cell phone isn’t exciting anymore and just like your last car or clothes stopped pleasing you after a couple of days/weeks.

      "I’m writing anonymously because I used to work at Google as a software engineer and it’s possible I end up working there again some day. I left Google a few years ago and I work at another major tech company now. There were indeed a lot of good things about working there. But it wasn’t as perfect as some people seem to expect. Here are some negatives:Software engineers are treated as equivalent by the interviewing system, which requires everyone to be judged on the same sort of standard engineering interview questions. I had a Ph.D. but my specialized knowledge was irrelevant to the hiring process; I got the same interviews that a student fresh out of undergrad would have. The problem here is that it devalues those with specialized knowledge that might actually benefit the company.Ph.D. researchers are usually hired as “software engineers”. I actually worked in Google Research for a time (now re-branded as Google AI) but still only got the “engineer” title. This was a negative and I think impacted my career negatively, both at Google and in my later job search.The promotion system penalizes work on innovative projects, and rewards those who churn out incremental small features to existing products. As a Ph.D. with a research background, I was routinely asked to do build prototypes of new ideas or work on new products that weren’t public. I did a great job at this, but despite great performance reviews (“strongly exceeds expectations”, which I got for a couple years in a row) I was unable to get promoted by the anonymous promotion committee. This committee is made up of people who don’t know your work and can only read about what you did from a write you and your manager and peers make. This is supposed to reduce bias. But in my case I had peers and a manager and other more senior people who vouched for me and supported my promotion, and still the committee rejected it. The reason was simply that I didn’t have enough “impact” since the projects were internal and hadn’t launched to the public yet. As an “L4 employee” — one step below “senior” — the official job description for Senior (L5) stated that having impact on the group’s work and delivering the assigned projects was good enough for promotion, and that impact on “end users” wasn’t required. Indeed, I delivered the requested work; the only reason it didn’t have “end user impact” was that much higher-level managers would change strategy and cancel projects I had worked on. Meanwhile… I was getting denied promotion, but there were other people getting promoted for adding in crappy little features to Google Plus, like forcing YouTube commenters to have a Google Plus account. Later, similar people were getting promoted for work on *removing* Google Plus integration once they cancelled it. I was only not promoted since my project got cancelled just before it launched; other people launching stupid things were rewarded for it. This promotion policy, incidentally, is probably one of the reasons Google has so many weird similar products (like 3 different chat apps) and why they’re also removing support for projects all the time.Google sometimes makes “lowball” salary offers. I quit Google for a much better position at a higher level and higher pay elsewhere. But later I re-applied to Google and got an offer for L5 — in essence, a promotion by leaving and re-interviewing. Previous managers were enthusiastic and I found a new team that needed my specialized knowledge. However, after going through the interview process, I was given an offer to return at the higher lever — but I’d only be making the same $$ that I made prior to leaving! It was much less than my then-current compensation at a Google competitor. I told the recruiter that I’d only come back for a reasonable L5 salary, and I named a number. He said that Google’s policy was that they wouldn’t change the offer unless I had a competing offer from a competitor. I told them that “I’m working for your competitor right now! If you want me to switch jobs you need to pay for my talent, and I’m making a lot more than your offer.” He communicated that to the “compensation” folks but they reiterated that they would only give me a higher (read “market-rate”) if I had yet another competing offer. I didn’t, so I declined. No harm done except for a great waste of time on both sides.Google has changed their stock-”refresh” policy so that you can’t get an additional stock grant in the same year you join. I was interviewing to return to Google in January. So on top of the low-ball offer, I would miss an entire round of stock grants, putting my compensation a year “behind” someone who started just prior on Dec 31. No thanks. Basically, Google is screwing over — on average — people who start before July 1 in any given year. If I return to Google I’ll make sure to time it right.Google has some good engineering systems, but also some really clunky and annoying ones. A lot open source software stacks are much easier to work with. For instance, making a service that simply stays running in other datacenters when a datacenter goes down for maintenance is way harder than it should be. And I had to code in vim since there wasn’t good support for IDEs.Free food: sort of nice, but also easier to overeat and gain weight. Trust me, it’s not a perk for some of us; for me this was a negative, as strange as that may sound.The Bay Area is too darn expensive. I didn’t want to get promoted just to have more responsibility — instead I wanted to get promoted in order to be able to live without roommates in a not-too-terrible apartment. Any maybe one day, if I got promoted a 2nd time, I would have been able to buy my own condo. Living near work in your own house? Forget it. House prices plus insane California tax rates make it hard to get ahead, even for a Ph.D. software engineer at Google with expertise in machine learning. There are houses around the area with 4–8 people living together like college roommates where everyone is a highly-educated Google etc. employee. For me: it was time to grow up and claim a normal middle-class life elsewhere. In my case I actually moved to a cheaper city AND got a huge increase in compensation, since Google had artificially denied my promotion attempts and didn’t value my Ph.D. knowledge and domain experience the way other companies do.At this point I would consider returning to Google if I were offered a job at the L6 level, outside the Bay Area, and at the market-rate salary for that position, instead of the lowball salary for level L-1 that they tried to get me to accept the last time I interviewed there. I don’t think it’s reasonable to work there for very long at L4 or L5 in the Bay Area since it’s not affordable, unless you have a super cheap housing situation or an obvious path to a quick L6 promotion. But I’m also much less willing to go to the trouble of interviewing again, since they wasted my time with the insultingly low offer after I aced the interview.\n",

      "I interned at Google Research in summer 2016; so here’s my two cents: Basically, as Jon Orwant has pointed out, Google Research is not isolated from the rest of Google. The engineering teams and the research teams work closely, with the research team doing more experimental stuff while the engineering team working more on the product side. However, the boundaries are not well-defined — the researchers also contribute in product development, and the engineers contribute in running experiments. Secondly, broadly speaking, you can divide the research projects into two categories — short-term, like improving the performance of some already existing product; vs long-term, where you are creating a new product/framework altogether, such as TensorFlow or self-driving cars. As a researcher, the nature of your work will depend on which category your product lies in. For instance, you will likely have more flexibility [with regards to programming language, design decisions, experimental setup, etc.] for long term projects compared to short-term ones. Consequently, you would expect more challenges in the long-term projects, which will in turn often amount to more number of people involved in the project [directly or indirectly]. In comparison with research at a university, the benefits of working at Google Research [or any other large tech company, for that matter] are pretty much similar to the ones for software engineering positions at these companies — there will always be a lot of cool projects around you, which you can contribute to, and whatever you’re working on, there will be many very smart people around you with whom you can brainstorm or ask for help on various components of your project.\n",

      "It's pretty great. Some of the great things that distinguish design at Google from design at other popular tech companies:We have all-star engineers, and the implications of that in the design process shouldn't be understated. It encourages designers to think really big, knowing that many of the crazy ideas can actually be done. I've referred several times to the idea of invoking \"Google [algorithmic] magic\" to get something done during brainstorming.Many of the designers themselves have a pretty substantial technical background. The whole technical designer \"unicorn\" idea isn't so rare. I generally think that it's helpful for designs in tech to have technical knowledge. There's a pretty good prototyping culture. I haven't seen as much of the engineer vs. designer culture clash that's sometimes apparent at other companies.Despite being a huge, well-known company, the design culture at Google is relatively young since everything was shaken up in 2011, so each designer has a good amount of influence in how design process in the company can be improved.Employees get to see most of the secret projects going on in the company and can easily chat with others, and it's basically built-in design inspiration from people who are doing cutting-edge work. It seems like there is constantly an abundance of exciting projects happening within the company that, when they make it to the public, will get designers thinking of new ideas. Working at Google is kind of like an early access pass for that.While Google's obviously a for-profit company, I do think that the work that the company is doing genuinely helps people. That's something that's crucially important to me when considering work, especially from a \"user-centered design\" perspective. This, combined with the breadth of impact at which Google operates, is really appealing to me.I have the chance to meet and work with people whose work I previously read about or used, which is really neat.The downsides include:Since the design culture is young, and the company is heavily engineering-oriented, it can sometimes feel out of place to be a designer. This was only really an issue for me during the first couple of weeks, though.As a large company, Google has the normal sort of organizational obstacles that you might expect. It's not as easy to move forward with things as in the average early-stage startup. It's not totally a bad thing, since it ensures high quality.A more neutral distinction is that since Google operates at large scale, the \"user\" to design for often doesn't have that many clear, defining features; we kind of literally design for everyone. As someone whose HCI education encouraged him to zone in on specific target audiences (ex: finding a few example users to personally interview), this is a different way of thinking. I just started on Chrome UX a couple months ago, so these are all early thoughts. Maybe I'll update this answer down the road. Short answer: I'm super fortunate to be at Google as a designer.\n",

      "It certainly wouldn’t suit some people. It is a lot of struggling with ill-defined problems until you can wrestle them into submission… one of those problems is, how should I manage my career at Google? There is enormous scope for doing interesting and world-changing things… along with the enormous responsibility of not being evil while changing the world. Trouble is, it’s so easy to do evil by accident. SRE is genuinely hard… while on call, you’re the point person for operating one aspect of the biggest machine on the planet. Literally anything can pop up on your phone at any hour during your shift, and you have to drop everything and get on your computer and figure out what to do with it. That means knowing your system so well you can debug it from memory, and knowing your own limitations so well you can be absolutely sure you will recognise that this is something you should not be working on alone, and instead of chase the problem directly you need to activate incident management, and by doing so bring in lots of help. The job isn’t to fix it, it is to ensure that it gets fixed. One time I said to a manager, about how I found it to work in SRE, that “This is the best computer game in existence. It’s a professional sport, you cannot pay to play, but it’s the best game out there”. I stand by that, it’s incredibly rewarding. But like any pro sport, it is also tough. How would you feel if you knew that, at the point in time the system paged, users all over the world had already had page loads fail, and that you had two or three minutes before someone started tweeting that Google had an outage? There are a couple of SRE teams that work like that. Not mine, mine is more like when the pager goes off with the scariest page, you have 18 minutes to get the system back online or it’s going to be full-page news stories tomorrow; that page has fired for real only once, and it did create headlines.\n",
