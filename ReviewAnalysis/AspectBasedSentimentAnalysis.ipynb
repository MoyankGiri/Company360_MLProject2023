       " 'This is not the energized Google with a clear purpose that I joined 10 years ago. Most Google decisions are reactive to the market, \"me too\" not disruptive. They pay loads of money to lots of people to live paycheck to paycheck in the most expensive cities in the world. Few people have been there longer than a few years. Managers are poorly trained. Some teams - my current team - are toxic and paranoid, worried more about the next quarterly performance evaluation than collaboration on a unified mission. Great for fresh outs to get something on the resume, painful for experienced Google veterans.',\n",

My mentor was incredibly helpful, providing guidance throughout the internship and ensuring that I had a clear understanding of my project's objectives.Unlike some internships where the projects might not make it to production, at Google, I worked on meaningful projects that had the potential to impact millions of users.With various events, talks, and opportunities, it was easy to connect with both fellow interns and full-time Googlers. I made some lasting professional connections.While collaboration is encouraged, the environment can sometimes feel competitive, given the sheer talent pool. Google's massive scale can be both a blessing and a curse. At times, I felt lost navigating the vast codebase and understanding where my contributions fit in the bigger picture.With great perks come great responsibilities. The expectations for delivery and performance can be high, which might be stressful for some.Interning at Google was a transformative experience. It provided a glimpse into the world of tech at a scale that very few companies can match. While there were challenges and moments of pressure, the support system, the learning opportunities, and the chance to make a tangible impact outweighed the negatives.I would recommend this internship to anyone looking to challenge themselves and grow rapidly in a tech-centric environment.
