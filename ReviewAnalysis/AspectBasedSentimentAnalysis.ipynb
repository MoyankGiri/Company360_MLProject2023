And during the (rare) super busy periods, it made me more than happy and willing to work overtime where needed. They made me feel that they cared about what I wanted, so that made me care even more about my job.I had 2 amazing managers who were both great mentors. They encouraged me and trusted me after my training was complete to work efficiently on my own while still checking in regularly.Once ContentCal was bought by Adobe, it was still like that but I was made redundant a few months later.However, Adobe made the process so much easier than my previous redundancies at other companies and they were so helpful and they paid me more than fairly.I will always have a positive memory of my time there, and wouldn’t say no to returning if the right opportunity opened up for me there.',\n",

They're not always skilled to have a comprehending head in the foxholes with members of the roles they oversee, so this can be frustrating when their personality lacks empathy on top of unfamiliarity of inner workings.
