In a recent interview with actor Kareena Kapoor Khan on her show “What Women Want”, the Shark Tank India judge and SUGAR Cosmetics CEO opened up about some of the sexist encounters she has faced early in her career.\n",
            "The entrepreneur shared an incident where she was asked to dress differently in order to secure a job offer early in her career. While the IIT-IIM grad complied at the time because she wanted the job, she now says she would object to such a request if it were to happen again. She explained how she called her mother overnight and changed her wardrobe to oversized men’s shirts during her internship at ITC, just so that her clothing wouldn't be the reason she didn't get the job.\n",
            "“When I was doing my internship at ITC, there was a time when I was told that the jeans and the tight tops that I wear to the factory are not okay. So I remember, overnight, I had called my mother from Delhi to Saharanpur with these big baggy shirts, men’s shirts, and every single day of my 2-month internship I wore those oversized men’s shirts because I didn’t want that to be the reason I don’t get a job offer,\" she told Khan.READ MOREPlayback speed1x NormalQualityAutoBack360pAutoBack0.25x0.5x1x Normal1.5x2x/SkipAds by \n",
            "Singh also recalled being told by an investor that they don't invest in women-founded companies and that she would only receive funding if her husband joined the business.

The series hopes to inspire thousands of potential Indian entrepreneurs who are on the cusp of starting up or have ventured recently or are in schools and colleges dreaming of becoming founders.\n",
            "Vineeta Singh, co-founder and CEO of SUGAR Cosmetics, is a marathon runner. She has seemingly taken the best of running principles and applied them to her business and career. For instance, not giving up the race mid-way, varying the pace of the run, sticking to her convictions and not losing sight of the end goal. Talking of conviction, the IIT-Madras and IIM-Ahmedabad alumnus rejected an offer of Rs 1 crore soon after graduating from management school back in 2007 because she wanted to become an entrepreneur.\n",
            "Years later, Singh and her team came close to winding down SUGAR Cosmetics on multiple occasions as the company faced bankruptcy. But the spirit of running teaches you something important: take that next step no matter what. The 39-year-old, who is also one of the judges of Shark Tank India, not only withstood the currents but also built a rising cosmetic brand. In its Series D round in 2022, the company, which began with a seed fund of Rs 1 crore, raised $50 million from L Catterton, A91 Partners, Elevation Capital and India Quotient at a valuation close to $500 million. Its top line grew 75% to Rs 222 crore in FY22.\n",
            "Today, SUGAR Cosmetics offers its customers over 550 products, catering to lips, skin, eyes and so on. The company has placed its products in over 40,000 retail outlets, and is looking to bump that up to 1 lakh outlets over the next 12 months. There are also plans to open 250 exclusive stores by the end of FY24.\n",
            "Though the revenue split between online and offline channels is currently 50:50, soon 60% of the revenue is expected to come from offline stores. SUGAR Cosmetics’ predominant customer profile consists of young Indian women, not just in metros but also in tier-II and tier-III cities and towns, which account for 60-65% of its revenue.\n",
            "The Germ\n",
            "SUGAR Cosmetics, the brand Singh co-founded with her husband Kaushik Mukherjee in 2015, wasn’t an idea that found any support from investors initially. The founders formed a parent company called Vellvette Lifestyle Pvt Ltd in 2012 after their earlier venture, Fab Bag, a cosmetic subscription service, ran into rough weather.\n",
            "At that time, the subscription venture was serving a young demographic band (18-30 years). “Our close proximity to this target group, a closed-loop feedback system, and the ability to send 200 products each year to 100,000 women gave us a unique vantage point,” says Singh. The Indian beauty industry, dominated by multinational brands, had its own constraints with many products not suited for the Indian complexion. “This was why the audience either preferred to source makeup and beauty products from other countries or ended up with incorrect shades that wouldn’t pair with their Indian skin tones,” says Singh.\n",
            "The feedback that they received from young Indian women during their pilot runs was very clear. They were looking at lipstick shades and other cosmetic products that would go well with their skin tones. They were looking at alternatives to international brands that would withstand the pollution and heat on the streets. “We sensed that mindset shift. This led to SUGAR in 2015,” says Singh. The company’s unusual name was derived from the expression ‘sugar rush’, which happens when someone feels happy and energetic after eating sugar-filled items such as lollies.\n",
            "Despite the launch, more than 100 potential investors were of the opinion that the idea would not work. “They felt it was a cluttered market. The venture capital funds had told us that per capita consumption of cosmetics in India was 1/8th of any western market or Southeast Asia. In our own board meetings, questions were raised about costs. Building a cosmetic brand from scratch would cost us anything upwards of Rs 50 crore as brand building was an expensive exercise,” says Singh. At that point they had Rs 30 lakh in the company account.\n",
            "The early days\n",
            "The initial years, as expected, were tough. SUGAR Cosmetics didn’t have enough capital, fundraising was very hard, and it was close to going bankrupt multiple times. “We didn’t even have money to order stock. The retailers would shoo us away. We shrank our team and our warehouse and we almost shut down,” recalls Singh.\n",
            "But even in those circumstances, Singh and Mukherjee never doubted the scale of the opportunity before them. “Women were loving what we offered. We got underestimated in the first 2-3 years and that sometimes is an advantage. If you get excess capital early, that can lead to bad habits,” she says.\n",
            "Their earlier venture Fab Bag was funded by India Quotient. But since Fab Bag had not scaled, they couldn’t support SUGAR Cosmetics. However, the promoters of the fund were willing to give them a sum of Rs 1 crore in their personal capacity. “That gesture gave us the working capital to invest in our products. It was their personal money, so we couldn’t let them down at any cost.”\n",
            "“I remember in 2012-13, we were hearing reasons like: ‘We don’t invest in solo women founders.’ I am grateful for how things have changed in the last 15 years,” says Singh.\n",
            "The back story\n",
            "Singh was born in Gujarat’s Anand district and later brought up in New Delhi — her parents had moved to the national capital in search of better job opportunities. “My parents freaked out when I said I wanted to become an entrepreneur,” she says. Her father, Tej Singh, had spent his entire life trying to discover protein structures to enable development of various drugs that could treat cancer and other diseases.\n",
            "When she turned down the Rs 1 crore campus placement offer, her parents were astonished. “It’s a lot more common now, but back in 2007, I was just 23, and it felt a little unnerving to be featured on the cover of a prominent magazine for being the first and youngest B-school graduate to decline a Rs 1 crore placement offer.”\n",
            "The road ahead\n",
            "The idea is to have one more year of massive growth and then push for profitability, says Singh. The company registered a loss of Rs 76.2 crore in FY22 as against a loss of Rs 21.1 crore in FY21. Its topline, however, grew 75% during the period to Rs 222 crore.\n",
            "“We are eyeing 100% year-on-year revenue growth over last year and are sharply focusing on offline distribution expansion in line with our omni-channel strategy. We also aim to further expand to international markets such as the US, Russia, GCC and Nepal,” said Singh. The ambition is to become a global cosmetic brand.\n",
            "Often, it's not about how well you sprint but how well you last the marathon.\n",

            "The \"Shark\" added that it's a misconception that crying at work means that she can't take the pressure. \"I have seen that because women are able to have this outlet where they are able to cry it out, they are very strong when they are done with it. I found that there is a big power in crying out a failure or a setback. It should be encouraged at work and managers should understand that it's a form of communication an they should take it like that rather than as a breakdown,\" Vineeta Singh said.\n",

            "\"Mumbai, I moved with my first start-up at 23, and it was hard because at that time I really had to figure a way out to live independently, which means renting a house and getting your help in place and all of that at the first salary of Rs. 10,000, which then became, 25,000 which then eventually became 50,000, which then seemed like a luxury.

I think before all the 100 VC (venture capital) rejections I got 100 rickshaw driver rejections in my whole journey,\" she told the publication.\n",

All of that and just people helping out at times when I'm driving alone on the road at 1 am, and if the car gets stuck in some manhole people stop in the middle of the rain and help you the car out. I mean those are unthinkable anywhere else in the world. So yes, I fell in love with the city for its people.\"\n",

            "“I enjoy Shark Tank India as a program and I think it is a great platform for our budding entrepreneurs. But whenever I think of sharks, I think of the movie ‘Jaws’ and bleeding,” Goenka tweeted along with data about the judges’ ventures that listed their profits for financial year 2021-2022.\n",
            "The data, that didn’t mention a source, listed only Aman Gupta’s company boAt reporting Rs 79 crore in profit while Mittal’s shaadi.com apparently was at a loss of Rs 27 crore in financial year 2020. It also said there has been no disclosure on profit since then.\n",
            "Peyush Bansal’s Lenskart was apparently at a loss of Rs 102 crores while Vineeta Singh’s Sugar Cosmetics was at a loss of Rs 75 crore. New entrant to the judges’ panel Amit Jain’s company Cardekho.com was also apparently loss making the last year with Rs 246 crores in negative.\n",
            "As Namita Thapar’s Emcure Pharmaceuticals is not a start-up, it didn’t make it to the list.\n",
            "Two days after Goenka’s viral tweet that got 2.1 million views, Anupam Mittal had a response.\n",
            "“I know you meant it in jest so with all due respect sir, I think u reacted to what appears to be superficial, biased & incomplete data. Happy to learn from stalwarts, but just to clarify, like u, the sharks don’t bleed red, we bleed blue & that’s why we do what we do,” Mittal tweeted slamming the data but also said he was happy to learn from industry stalwarts like Goenka.\n",
